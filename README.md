# interview-questions
Just some of the questions I deem now important to ask.

1. What's the policy about electric unicycles? Permitted to bring them in or some special place for storing them?
2. What is the state of the documentation? Like how many things are documented and how up-to-date is it?
3. What's going to be the main scope of the job: writing new things, rewriting the old ones, slightly adjusting them or building a new thing from ready-to-go blocks?
